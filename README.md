# Social-media-Project

Getting started 
------------------
To get the frotend running locally:
- Clone this repo 
- npm install to install all required dependencies
- npm start to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)

Local web server will use port 3000. 

Go into the api folder and inside the config file, change the host to the IP address present on your device. To check the ip address, go under command line prompt and type ipconfig. Copy the IPv4 address present in the command line and change the address under host to the new IPv4 address on your device.
